### How to Run Linear Regression in Python

Can you explain the basic concept of linear regression and its purpose in the context of machine learning and data analysis?

Linear regression allows us to find a straight line that "best fits" a set of scattered data points, and further allows prediction of new data points.  

Input = independent feature x or explanatory variable

Output = dependent feature, y or response variable

Slope = steepness of the regression

Correlation= the relation b/n 2 vars in terms of strength and degree, values b/n -1.0 and 1.0 

Residual = vertical distance b/n a data point and the line of regression, variance

import scikit-learn for the LinearRegression class. 

### Linear Regression in Python

### Intro to Simple Linear Regressions

Regression analysis explores the relationship b/n a quantitative response variable and one or more explanatory variables.

Start by plotting the data pairs. 

One explanatory variable is simple regression vs mutliple regression. 

Sometimes you may want to measure the strength of the relationship b/n x and y.

note: random error component, there will be some variablity in the data points


### Train and Test Splits

What is the purpose of splitting the dataset into train and test sets, and how does this contribute to the evaluation of a machine learning model’s performance?

### What is Linear Regression





Describe the process of implementing a linear regression model using Python’s Scikit Learn library, including the necessary steps and functions.
