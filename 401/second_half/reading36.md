### 6 Tips

2. From the “6 tips to ace a whiteboard programming interview” article, can you identify and explain at least two strategies that can help improve your performance during a whiteboard programming interview?

1. don't sweat the small stuff is a motto that I need to live up to for these interviews. I think saying things like "I would look that up" would help me be a little more calm. The almost remembering is my tripping point and so I like this strategy tip.

2. I like this section on accepting criticism too. I have had interviews with follow up questions where I have been so embarassed I couldn't even try to answer the question and I wish that I could regroup and understand the interview team is expressing how they are giving me a chance.
