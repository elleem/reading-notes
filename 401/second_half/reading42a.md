## Ethics in Tech


### Ethics in Technology--Will democracy survive big data and AI?

Will democracy survive big data and AI is dated 2/25/2017.

There have been many watershed moments in this discussion since this article was published, but this is a comprehensive overlook regarding these issues.

They completely do not cover the Russians influencing the 2016 elections. 

The example in this article regarding giving people fitness bracelets is shameful journalism and does not cover how the data will be used to offer citizens differently priced health care plans based on the collected data, although it is covered in the long list of further readings. 

Interesting point regarding programming computers to programming people. 

I think with the advent of targeted ads on social media platforms understanding this point is more relevant than ever.

The rate at citizens are creating data is next level, as the article points out, but on top of that the ability to respond to user feedback is a at a new level as well.

Companies have the ability to deploy targeted content and see the interaction at a major level. 

I recently read [Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O'Neil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_of_Math_Destruction) where she covered the scalabilty of [microtargeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtargeting#:~:text=Microtargeting%20is%20the%20use%20of,product%20or%20a%20political%20candidate.) in political campaigns, along with geofencing. This is covered much better in the further reading section versus the full article. 

Given how human biases work and how difficult they are to dislodge once formed, partisan politics, and little to no regulation on disinformation, democracy is facing a high stakes.

Cool utopia proposal at the end here. Climate Olympics sounds amazing. 

Interesting theory on the digital nervous system. 

90 countries were already using Nudging in 2017.

Really liked the "right to copy" idea proposed. 


### Ethics in the Workplace -- Microsoft Employees demand end of ICE contract

As of 2/6/2023 1000 children are still separated from their families and [the policy continues](https://www.vera.org/news/children-are-still-being-separated-from-their-families-at-the-border). 

I'm glad the protest worked with Microsoft and I looked up the current status, which is still hands off. Great to see a success.
