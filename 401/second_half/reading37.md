### ES6 Syntax and Feature Overview

1. In the context of ES6 Syntax and Feature Overview, what are three key features introduced in ES6 that improve upon the previous version of JavaScript, and briefly explain their benefits?

- `let` in addition to `var`, which allows for block-scoped variables. Does not hoist. Cannot be redeclared.

- introduced `const` keyword. Not immutable, cannot be redeclared/reassigned. 

- introduced arrow functions and implicit returns, providing a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. Although shorter, they also are more readable and reduce the need for explicit function bindings. As a testament to where I am entering this coding journey, `bind()` and `self=this` is something that I have read about, but have never written. 

This article also covers template literals, which I was surprised to read had not been available prior to this and destructuring, allows curly bracket to assign properties of an object to their own variable. 

Finally, there were improved class syntax options for the prototype-based constructor function, along with the introduction of the `extends` keyword, and the introduction of the `Promise` keyword, eliminating `callback`, which again, up until this reading I would not have known existed!

2. After reading “Tailwind in 15 minutes,” can you describe the purpose of utility classes in Tailwind CSS and provide an example of how to use them to style an HTML element?

3. Based on “Why to use Next.js,” explain the main advantages of using Next.js for web development, and provide a brief comparison between traditional client-side rendering and Next.js’s server-side rendering approach.
