## React 3

#### Things I Want to Know More About

### React Context

1. What is React Context, and how does it help in managing state and data sharing in a React application?

2. Explain the useContext Hook and how it can be used to access data from a React Context within a functional component.

3. Describe the purpose of Next.js, and provide an example from the Vercel Next.js Examples reading on how it can be used to build a scalable web application

With React you can only render on the client side.

Next.js allows you choose the client or server side, or both, which is more scalable.

Essentially, this offers faster initial page loads (pre-renders the HTML and sends to the client), improved SEO, and simplier routing. 

From the link to the Vercel github, it seems that  the "Next.js E-Commerce Starter" is an  example from the Vercel Next.js Examples demonstrating how it can be used to build a scalable e-commerce web application. 

It uses SSR for product pages, SSG for static pages like About and Contact, and API routes for handling user actions like adding a product to the shopping cart. 

It also demonstrates how to integrate with external APIs for product data and handle user authentication, all while ensuring fast page loads and an excellent user experience.
