### Graphs Cheat Sheet

#### Graph Terminology:

Vertex/Node: Data object in a graph with zero or more adjacent vertices.

Edge: Connection between two nodes.

Neighbor: Adjacent nodes connected by an edge.

Degree: Number of edges connected to a vertex.

#### Directed vs Undirected Graphs:

Undirected Graph: Each edge is undirected or bidirectional.

Directed Graph (Digraph): Every edge is directed with specific requirements.
Graph Types:

Complete Graph: All nodes are connected to each other.

Connected Graph: All nodes have at least one edge.

Disconnected Graph: Some nodes may not have edges.

#### Acyclic vs Cyclic Graphs:

Acyclic Graph: Directed graph without cycles.

Cyclic Graph: Graph that contains cycles.


#### Graph Representation:

Adjacency Matrix: 2D array representing connections between vertices.

Adjacency List: Collection of linked lists or arrays listing connected vertices.

#### Weighted Graphs:

Weighted Graph: Graph with numbers assigned to edges (weights).

Represented through matrices or lists, including weights and adjacent vertices.


#### Graph Traversals:

Breadth-First Traversal: Visiting nodes level by level, starting from a specific node.

Depth-First Traversal: Visiting nodes by exploring each subtree depth-wise.
