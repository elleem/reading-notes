## Mindset

### Upgrade your skills via practice

Never a truer statement was written. As I mentioned, I play ice hockey, but this was a multi-year journey, where I did a lot of working on things I am bad at. I am hoping to bring this mindset to coding. One thing I learned in 301 was to focus more on what is personally difficult for me and keep after it. The one aspect I struggle with is repeated often. I am working on how to keep after deliberate and hard practice.

### Growth Mindset

Covers the idea of our brain's capacity to learn is on a learning curve. "not yet"

### Grit

Understanding that learning quickly isn't the path to success, it's about grit.

I think it's interesting how many different settings that were studied to look at success.

How to build grit? Not known, but building upon Carol's talk it's likely a growth mindset.

### Redefining Success

### Emotional Bias

It would surprise no one in my life to see that I scored low on self-awareness, since I would say I have a very high imposter's syndrome. 

That being said, I think of myself as a self-contained person, with a low tolerance for bringing my troubles to work or allow a bad experience to become a bad day. 

I am working hard on better social awareness, but I would say some of my personal shyness can be reflected in personal interactions. I love pair programming for helping me get through this type of issue and I don't mind when I am called in class to help with this too. 

### Assessing Bias

One of my strengths is being curious in others and experiences outside of my personal biases and familiarity. 

I scored lower in being effectively courageous and acting with courage.

I frequently do not prioritize self-care, especially at work.

I have been in difficult situations at work, but I have not always stepped up to confront people. 

I will work on prioritizing self-care at work in the coming weeks.
