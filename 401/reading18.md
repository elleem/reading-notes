## Cryptography

#### Things I Want to Know More About


### Encryptions, Decryption and Hacking

1. What is the basic principle behind the Caesar Cipher, and how was it used historically?

shift by 6 letters, rewrite using the same letters. Allowed encrypted messages to be sent confidentially. 

Just think of the level of paranoia considering a hypothetical literacy rate of 15%. 

### Ceasar Cipher

YHWH 

Limited number of shifts

### Cryptography Crash Course

Defensive depth--like a castle 

First more complex crypto, created by IBM, but cracked in 2 days as computing power increased.

AES--uses much bigger bit keys, 128 bit key would take trillions of years to be broken by brute force. 

### Intro to Cryptography

### How Computers Generate Random Numbers



2. What are the key differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption? How is asymmetric used in secure communication today?

3. How do computers generate random numbers, and what are the differences between true random number generation (TRNG) and pseudo-random number generation (PRNG)? Discuss their use cases in cryptography.

4. Whatâ€™s the difference between encryption and decryption? Explain with an analogy.
