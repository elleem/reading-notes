## SQL Notes

SELECT [stuff you want to select] FROM [table that it is in]; 
* splat = the whole table short cut

### ORDER BY
SELECT [stuff you want to select] FROM [table that it is in] ORDER BY [column you want]; 

  ASC and DESC

### LIMIT
SELECT * FROM artists LIMIT [# to limit by]; 

### OFFSET
SELECT * FROM artists LIMIT [# to limit by] OFFSET [# of rows to skip];

### COUNT
COUNT(*); 
to see how much data


### AND OR
An AND is essentially multiplication. An OR is logic addition, so AND first and then OR, use parenthesis to specify the order of operations
### Operators
= equal
< less than
> greater than
<= less than or equal
>= greater than or equal
!= not equal
<> not equal 

LIKE a string matches a pattern
ILIKE case insensitive version of LIKE
SIMILAR TO a string matches a regex pattern



## Engineering Readings

What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
<br>
 A deep understanding of how to be efficient. That doesn’t mean always working and closing as many tickets as possible, but spending time documenting solutions/errors, as well as spending time to plan and organize my own day and keeping up with smaller, incremental task items that require sustained effort to solve, but I don’t always have big blocks of time to devote to solving. A dedication for long names on variables. 
 <br>
What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
<br>
Rubber duck explanations to check my own understanding, especially using pseudo code and manually solving the problems
Before thinking, I am so stuck and I can’t get unstuck and I need help–thoroughly preparing my debugging steps so that I can explain what I have told my program to do. 
Practice micro-solutions. I have encountered some practice of smaller problems in 301 in javascript and I continue to practice these.
