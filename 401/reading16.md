## Serverless Functions

#### Things I Want to Know More About


### What is Serverless Computing? 

1. What are the key characteristics of serverless computing, and how does it differ from traditional server-based architectures?

Cloud application development and execution model w/o managing servers, provider provisions the cloud infrastructure required to run your code, scales, provides routine infrastructure management and maintenance, such as OS updates, patches, security, capacity and system monitoring. 

It allows devs to focus on code and not infrastructure. 

Allows devs to use any language, you pay for execution only.


### venv--creation virtual environments

virtual environments w/ independent set of python packages installed in their site directories.

A virtual environment is a self-contained Python environment that allows devs to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts with other projects that may require different versions of the same package.

Once installed, you can use pip to install packages. 

Use requirements.txt to list all the required packages to share with other developers. 

### Vercel

2. How can one get started with Vercel, and what are the main steps involved in deploying a serverless function using Vercel?

### http.server

### Requests

4. What is the Requests library in Python, and how can it be used to interact with APIs by sending HTTP requests? Can you provide an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library?

### Python and APIs

3. What are APIs, and how can they be utilized in Python applications to access and manipulate data from external sources?

### What is Serverless? 

You are outsourcing servers to the cloud providers. 

Bare Metal is you are deploying, configuring, patches.

VM--resource optimization, but you still have to set up everything.

Containers--Docker, packaging code and dependencies, into one structure

Serverless--focused on business logic, FaaS, functions as a service, event driven architecture. Highly available, in multiple zones, and fault tolerant.

Cons--timeouts if your code does not execute within the window, latency.
