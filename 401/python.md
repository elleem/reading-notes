### Getting Started with Python

variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can change type after being set. type() will help you understand which type.

case sensitive 


1. List any features of Python that you like/dislike most so far.

Indentation, instead of curly brackets. I will likely be back and forth with the variable names, due to mutation. I think I can overcome this by declaring constant variables. I guess snake_case is pretty cool and all caps constants is similar to other variable assignments I have covered. 

2. List some of the ways that Python is similar and different to JavaScript.

there are additional key words, some for debugging, some for specific conditional statements that are a slightly different. Including global.

it is object based. 

Javascript can be used for backend and front end.

No variable key words to assign a variable.

Many values can be assigned to one variable.

There are tuples (multiple items in a single variable)! Anyway, as I would expect from a language that is handling a lot of data there are also sets and dictionaries, in addition to arrays (lists).
