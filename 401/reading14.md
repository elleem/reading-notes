## Data Visualization

#### Things I Want to Know More About



### Matplotlib Tutorial

Allows you to illustrate data, creating a figure, plotting area, plots lines, and decorates with labels, auto generates the x values, if you only provide one value.

Allows for customizing all sorts of properties, using step(), can separate lines for additional space. 

`plt.xlim(X.min()*1.1, X.max()*1.1)`
`plt.ylim(C.min()*1.1, C.max()*1.1)`

Allows customization of ticks, and spines. 

Use label to allow for a legend, use annoatate to add points on the illustration. 

Allows transparency for overlapping items. 

Allows for even more control using figures, subplot, and axes. 

A figure (numbering starts from 1) in matplotlib means the whole window in the user interface. Within this figure there can be subplots. While subplot positions the plots in a regular grid, axes allows free placement within the figure. 

Allows for animations, including drip drop, like rain. Must save this into a video in html in order to show it. 

Wow so many links to cool tutorials, as if the earthquake demonstration weren't cool enough!

There is a full list of galleries. [matplotlib gallery](https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/gallery.html)

The colors are amazing. 

### Seaborn Tutorial

A library for making statistical graphics in Python, building on matplotlib and integrating with pandas. Lets you focus on the elements of your plots, rather than the details on how to draw them.

There is a default theme, but more options, and you can control style and scale. 

### Bokeh Tutorial

### Seaborn Cheat Sheet


1. What are the key differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh libraries in terms of their features and use cases? Provide an example of a specific visualization that is more suitable for each library.

2. In the Seaborn library, what are the main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots? Briefly explain the purpose of each type of plot and provide an example use case.

3. Discuss the role of the Seaborn Cheat Sheet in a Python developerâ€™s workflow. What are some key sections or elements featured in the cheat sheet that can help a developer quickly reference Seaborn functionalities?
