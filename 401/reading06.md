### How to use Random Module

How can the random module be utilized in Python to generate random numbers or make selections from a list, and what are some common functions available within the module?

`choice()` used on input collection objects

`shuffle()` shuffles elements in list in place

`randrange()` input int start, stop and step, then generates a randomnly selected element from the range

### What is Risk Analysis

In the context of software development, what is risk analysis, and what are the key steps involved in conducting a risk analysis for a software project?

the possibility of any unwanted incident, identify the risks in software and prioritizing them to test. You should prioritize the list, assign level of risk, and then categorize the risks. After this you can calculate the impact of risk. 

### Test coverage

What is test coverage and why is it an important (or potentially misleading) metric in software testing?

### Big O Notation

What is Big O notation, and how is it used to describe the performance of an algorithm? Give an example of an everyday task (not software related) that demonstrates O(n) time complexity.
