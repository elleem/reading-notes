### Testing and Modules

#### In Tests We Trust-- Test Driven Development with Python

Unit test are some pieces of code to exercise the input, output, and behavior of your code.

Test Driven Development is a strategy--tests first!

Be sure that test names are descriptive. 

Be sure to match up the name of the test file with the module file's name.

Be sure to have tests in their own folder.

There is a library pytest.

#### if__name__=="__main__"

If the python interpreter is running the module as the main program, it sets the special __name__ variable to have the value __main__

This really seems a lot like react, and now that I read down I see that it allows the modules to become reusable like react modules. Cool!

You can test whether your script is being run directly or being improted by something else by test __name__ variable.
