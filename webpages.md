### HTML Resources

#### Wireframe

- blueprint/ outline of the webpage or app
- process allows stakeolders to agree on where the information will be placed before the developers build
- generally during exploratory phase of project

#### Types of Wireframes

- there are free and paid tools
- can be pen/paper  or digital (Invision/Balsamiq/ UXPin/Wireframe.cc)
- *very* high level
- paper is great for very early stages when there are still lots of changes

#### Typical Processes for Wireframes

- Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
- Sketch > Code
- Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code
- Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code

#### Prework
> you need to have covered the first two steps; namely understanding who your audience is by way of user research, detailing requirements, creating user personas and defining use cases, and complementing this with further competitor and industry research.

- make sure you know your research and can quickly reference it
- make sure your user flow is mapped
- draft and sketch in wireframes

>How can you organise the content to support your usersâ€™ goals?

> Which information should be most prominent?

> Where should your main message go? What should the user see first when arriving at the page?

> What will the user expect to see on certain areas of the page?

> Which buttons or touch points does the user need to complete the desired actions?

#### Add Detail/ Start Testing

think about: 
- usability
- simple, instructional wording
- trust-building elements
- tooltips

#### Start Turning Wireframes into prototypes

- develop high fidelity prototypes
- can use Figma, Sketch

#### 3 Principles
 1. clarity
 2. confidence
 3. simplicity
