    <header><h2>History of President's Day</h2></header>
    <span>
    <p>Presidents' Day, officially Washington's Birthday, is a holiday in the United States celebrated on the third Monday of February to honor all persons who served in the office of president of the United States. </p>


        <p>The federal holiday specifically honors George Washington, who led the Continental Army to victory in the American Revolutionary War, presided at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, and was the first president of the United States. </p>

        <p>The day is a state holiday in most states, with official names including Washington's Birthday, Presidents' Day, President's Day, Presidents Day, and Washington's and Lincoln's Birthday. The various states use 15 different names. </p> 
        <p>Depending upon the specific law, the state holiday may officially celebrate Washington alone, Washington and Lincoln, or some other combination of U.S. presidents (such as Washington and Thomas Jefferson, who was born in April).</p>
        
        Washington's Birthday was celebrated on February 22 from 1879 until 1971, when the Uniform Monday Holiday Act moved it to the third Monday in February, which can occur from February 15 to the 21st. </p> 
        <p>The day eventually also became known as Presidents' Day (though the placement of the apostrophe, if any, varies) and is most often an occasion to remember all U.S. presidents, or to honor Abraham Lincoln's and Washington's birthdays together.
