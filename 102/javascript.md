## Javascript

### My top 3 takeaways
 - how computers work
 - javascript var
 - javascript animates the page

Allows anything beyond displaying info
    - content updates
    - animated graphics
    - interactive maps
    - scrolling videos
    - allows people to add their names for the potluck
    - allows the site to update when the user adds their info

> var fname = document.getElementById('first_name').value;
    var lname = document.getElementById('last_name').value;

### There are 3 Ways to declare a JavaScript Variable
- var
- left
- const

Variables are containers for storing data
Must have identified unique names (identifiers)

> Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.

> Names must begin with a letter

> Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)

>Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)

>Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

the equal sign is an assignment operator, not equal to, ie: x = x+5 meaning value +5

holds text and numbers

declare a variable with a keyword "var" and you can assign a value to the variable when you declare it, able to have multiple values

Can be an undefined value

strings

values will be concatenated 

### Computers are:
