## Things I Want to Know More About

### Images
<p> Use an image folder.  ``<img>` `<src>` `<alt>` `<title>` `<height>` `<width>`` be sure to specify height and width because images take longer to load. Placement impacts the display when paired with text and are dictated by the elements in the html, such as block ``<h1>`` and inline ``<img>``. </p>
<p> Save images in the right format, size, use the correct resolution (most computers only show 72 px per inch). Save images at the same width and height you want to use on your page. Save images with a resolution of 72 ppi. </p>
<p> Images with differnt colors should be jpegs. Use gif or png when saving images with few colors or large areas of the same color. <p>
<p> Vectors are resolution independent, created by placing points on a grid and drawing lines between those points. SVG isn't widespread...</p>
<p> JIFS?? </p>
<p> ``<figure>`` and ``<figcaption>``</p>
<p> Use JPEG for images that contain nature or variation in color and intensity is smooth. </p>
<p> Use PNG for any images that needs transparency or for images with text and objects like logos. Use GIF for animations. </p>
<p> Lossless (PNG, also higher storage and GIF) and lossy (JPEG) compression either lose data during compression, or does not. JPEGs are not transparent. PNGs and GIFs are. JPGs support a lot of colors. PNG and GIF only 256. </p>
