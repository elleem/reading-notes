### Things I Want to Know More About
CSS grid, Flexbox, screen resolution/screen size, CSS frameworks (should we use these)?


### Layout

<p>http://www.csszengarden.com/ </p>
<p> Display property is block or inline. Block create a new line for themselves. </p>
<p> Flexbox for one dimensional layouts</p>
<p> Converts child elements to be flex items. </p>
<p> flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis help the layout when it is challenged by content and viewport. </p>
<p> Grid allows control for multi-axis layouts display:grid </p>
<p> Introduces a few new primitives, such as repeat(), minmax(), and fr for fraction of the remaining space. 12 column grids. grid-row and grid-column allow you to structure items to take up more space for example. </p>
<p> Inline block forces layout to use block margin and padding. </p>
<p> Float alllows text to wrap around another element, such as an image. </p>
<p> column-count, column-width </p>
<p> "position" properties includes: relative, absolute, fixed, sticky<p>

### Re-read of Layout

<p> Everything is a block. Use width to control size. Borders, margin, padding and background colors.</p>
<p> Inline elements: img, b, i </p>
<p> Block elements: h1, p, ul, li </p>
<p> By default most browswers add a margin to the top of the h1 browser. </p>
<p> <strong>Normal, relative, absolute, fixed. </strong></p>
<p> z-index, allows you to control which elements sit on top. Use numbers. Higher will be closer to the front. </p>
<p> Float--if the containing element only contains floated elements, some browswers will treat it as if it has zero pixels. Now fixed with overflow at auto and width to 100%. </p>
<p> Fixed or liquid layouts. Fixed no matter the window. Liquid expand, but it can look very odd. Less control. </p>
<p> 960 pixel grid (960px so 940px header and then everything else breaks down from there.)</p>
<p> CSS Frameworks--having an online version of this book allows me to look at all these links right away! Yahoo link is not found. </p>
<p> @import</p>
<p> Later rules are more important. Later rules are more important. Later rules are more important. Maybe I will remember this...</p>
<p> height: 100vh; viewport height, about the size of the viewer's screen</p>
