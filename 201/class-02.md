## Basics HTML, CSS, & JS
---
### Text
 <p> h1 to h6, p, b <strong>, <em> is italic, </p>
 <p> superscript "th" in dates
         <sup> <sub> for H20, white space collapsing allows for readability in code, but does not impact how things are rendered on the page. My fav <br/>  Horizontal rule is <hr/> </p>
 <p> Don't forget     
         <blockquote> and <q> and <ins> and <del> </p>

### CSS
<p> Let's Cascade. Create those fun rules for the tags you built into your html. Thank god for VS Code and W3 Schools reference because there is a lot of style out there. </p>
<p> IMPORTANT: if 2+ rules, then the last rule and the more specific rule. !important will allow you to let that rule first. Inheritence, if you assign rules to the body then everything will follow along without you have to write the rules again. </p>

### JavaScript

<p> Define your variables using statements (on each line and end with a semicolon), curly braces indicate start and end of a <i>code block </i> w/o semicolon, case sensitve </p>

<p> Variables are variable key word variable name, assignment operator, and a variable value <br>
      var quantity = 3;
<p> Boolean, string, numbers <br> strings use quotation marks, numbers do not use quotes unless they will be declared a string, boolean are t/f </p>
<p> Naming variables a quick reference: starts with letter, $ or _, but not a number. no key words. name can use letters, numbers, $, or _, but not - or . (just like when I'm trying to save a word file and can't use whacks). case sensitive. try to use recognizable names. capitalize words after the first word, also can use _. </p>
<p> ARRAYS!! lists and values related to each other, esp if you don't know how many the list will contain. values assigned in the square brackets are array literal. List starts at 0 (NOT ONE.) Each array has a property called length. Oh cool, you can update the values in your list.</p>
<p> Expressions evaluates into a single value. Two types: expressions that assign value into a variable, expressions that use two or more values to return a single value (math usu). </p>
<p> Expressions rely on operators, create a single value from one or more values. You can do math, you can combine strings, compare operators, combine expressions for true/false. <br>I can see how increments and decrements would be useful in the world of likes/views for the social meds. <br> multplication and division are performed before + and -. Look at that cool grandTotal. </p>
<p> Strings, concatenation via + </p>
<p> Evalutions use values in your scripts to determine where or not they match the expected results, such as if/then/else. </p>
<p> Decisions you decide which path your script should go down. Set a condition, true one path, false the other path. </p>
<p> Loops allow the same steps to happen over and over. </p>
<p> (score >= pass) is operand comparison operator operand which can be evaluated with true/false. Use + to create expressions, or add operands. </p>
<p> Logical operators allow you to compare results of more than one comparison operator. </p>
<p> If statements check a condition, if match then execute the code. If not no action. If, else, then another section of code runs if the statement does not true.
