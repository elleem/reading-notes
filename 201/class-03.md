## Decisions and Loops (Switch Statements)
 <p> Important to remember: statement is the var = ""; </p>
 <p> Curly braces indicate the start and end of a code block {} </p>
 <p> If (hourNow >18) determines which code should run </p>
 <p> Name the var, assign the operator, and give it a value </p>
<p> Switch statements, start with a switch value, will run and keep running if there is a match. There is only 1 set of curly braces. Break allows you to put the breaks on the runaway train/code. With switch you can have a default option to run if none of the cases match. Switch staements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes. </p>
<p>Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next. Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators. </p>
<p> Type coercion, a string could be converted into a number. Sometimes called weak typing.</p>
<p>It is better to use strict operators. === or !==, than == or !=.</p>
<p> Falsy values are treated as if false, truthy values are treated as if true.</p>
<p> Short curcuit values, logical values are processed left to right, but stop when they find a result. This can help because you can code to put the code mostly likely to return true first, or put options requiring the most processing power last. </p>
<p> Loops check a condition and run until a false condition occurs. Using break (terms loop and runs next code) and continue (continue count, then check again, and run again). Loops are very helpful for arrays.</p>
<li>for, runs until match, usually you need to enter a counter. Counters can count up or down. </li>
<li>while, runs until match, but if you don't know how many times, no counter is needed. </li>
<li>do while, runs even if the condition is false. </li>

<p> Browsers will run JS first. If there are a lot of items, then your page will run slowly. If your condition is never false, the function runs until the browser runs out of space.
