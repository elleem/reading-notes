## HTML Links, JS Functions and Intro CSS Layout

### Links
<p> Links are a href="" </p>
<p> Uniform Resource Locator, otherwise use your local files. </p>
<p> Directories organize your code by places the pages for each different sections of the site into a new folder or directory. Child, grandchild, parent, grandparent. I used parent in my about me project. </p>
<p> Email links are mailto. target="_blank" to open a new window for the link. Generally don't open a new window. Tag page elements in order to create links to bring people back to specific parts in the page. 

### Layout
<p> How to control things on the page, relative, absolute, floats, and normal. </p>
<p> CSS treats each HTML element as if it is its own box, block level, or inline. </p>
<p> Block-level, start on a new line. Inline flow in between surrounding text. If one block-level element sists inside another block level element the outer element is the parent. In a navigation bar, div might group all the elements together and be the containing element. A box might be nested inside several other block-level elements. The containing element is the direct parent of the element. </p>
<ul>
<li> Normal flow is  left aligned, each element its own new line, stacked (CSS can allow you to restrict the size of paragraphs, using width) </li> 
<li> Relative position shifts element to t,r,l,b (in CSS postion: relative and then enter the top/bottom and left/right px to indent the content). </li>
<li> Absolute positioning takes items out of the normal positioning and allows user to scroll up and down the page (acts like the item isn't there, sometimes like a title on the side). </li> 
<li> Fixed positioning not impacted by scrolling and do not impact the surrounding elements (requires the position to be fixed, can be used to fix a navigation bar). </li>
<li> Float puts an element to the right or left and content flows around it (as if pulling out a quote, be sure to use width). It can also be used to put items side by side.  </li>
</ul>

<p> z-index--when boxes overlap, uses numbers to determine order, bring to front, send to back features </p>
<p> Clear float uses the values of left, right, box and allows no element to touch the left and right sides of the box.
