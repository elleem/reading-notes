## Intro

<p> lol, yeah no one runs the updates <br> lol, connection speeds are really variable <br> </p>
<p> How the web works
<li>
1. connect via your internet service provider
2. your browser connects to Domain Name Server, which tells your computer the IP address (12 digit address)
3. DNS returns and allows you to contact the web server (constantly connected to web, set up to send web pages) that hosts the website
4. web server sends the page you requested back to your brower <i>in packets </i>



## HTML
### Structure
<p> HTML uses headings, subheadings, and paragraphs, as if you were writing an old timey outline. It is hypertext because you are allowed links. </p>
<p>HTML uses tags, that open and close. </p>
<p> HTML uses attributes which allow names (extra info you are supply about the element's content) and values (info/setting) </p>
<p> Some extra important tags are body (everything you will see in browser), head (info about page, not in browser), and title (most important URL type title). </p>
<p>Due to different HTML versions, be sure to start with a DOCTYPE declaration</p>
<p> <!----> allows you to enter comments for the next person taking over your code base or just your forgetful self </p> 
<p> attributes allow you to id elements from other elements in your code </p>
<p> use class attributes to group elements together </p>
<p> block elements are lists, headers, and paragraphs </p>
<p> inline elements include basic text style and images </p>
<p> you can use elements to group elements in a block, such as div </p>
<p> you can use elements to group elements inline, such as span </p>
<p>iframes are windows w/in your page, you can control the src, height and wdith </p>
<p> meta is an empty tag that tells people name and content. </p>
<p> wow, robots such as nofollow and noindex exist and pragma prevents caching, and expires expire the cache</p>
<p>who hasn't seen an escape character in their day? &&& &euro</p>
