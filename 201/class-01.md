## Intro

<p> lol, yeah no one runs the updates <br> lol, connection speeds are really variable <br> </p>
<p> How the web works
<li>
1. connect via your internet service provider
2. your browser connects to Domain Name Server, which tells your computer the IP address (12 digit address)
3. DNS returns and allows you to contact the web server (constantly connected to web, set up to send web pages) that hosts the website
4. web server sends the page you requested back to your brower <i>in packets </i>



## HTML
### Structure
<p> HTML uses headings, subheadings, and paragraphs, as if you were writing an old timey outline. It is hypertext because you are allowed links. </p>
<p>HTML uses tags, that open and close. </p>
<p> HTML uses attributes which allow names (extra info you are supply about the element's content) and values (info/setting) </p>
<p> Some extra important tags are body (everything you will see in browser), head (info about page, not in browser), and title (most important URL type title). </p>
<p>Due to different HTML versions, be sure to start with a DOCTYPE declaration</p>
<p> <!----> allows you to enter comments for the next person taking over your code base or just your forgetful self </p> 
<p> attributes allow you to id elements from other elements in your code </p>
<p> use class attributes to group elements together </p>
<p> block elements are lists, headers, and paragraphs </p>
<p> inline elements include basic text style and images </p>
<p> you can use elements to group elements in a block, such as div </p>
<p> you can use elements to group elements inline, such as span </p>
<p>iframes are windows w/in your page, you can control the src, height and wdith </p>
<p> meta is an empty tag that tells people name and content. </p>
<p> wow, robots such as nofollow and noindex exist and pragma prevents caching, and expires expire the cache</p>
<p>who hasn't seen an escape character in their day? &&& &euro</p>

## HTML5
<p> really could have used factoring to make the upgrade sound impressive. Why have an android10, when you can go right to 20? </p>
<p> divs are still important for sectioning out your webpage, but now you can add in nav, article and footer tags. <br> You can user header and footer within articles and sections. </p>
<p> wow, I love this joke about nav maybe not being used to link things at the bottom of a page. </p>
<p> interested to hear more about articles, since they can be nested within each other and potentially be syndicated. </p>
<p> asides can be used inside articles to pull out a text quote. asides outside of articles act as a container for content related to other sites, like recent tweets. </p>
<p> figure is an available content tag </p>
<p> a allows you to turn an entire block into a link </p>
<p> site maps ftw--definitely feel these for wireframing. The fun creative part of coding is not just in writing. It starts in the conceptual phase of wire framing </p>


## Javascript
<p> scripts, scripts, scripts! </p>
