<p>What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element? </p>
<p> Rotate, scale, translate, skew an element. 
<p>Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.</p>
<p> I think you see scale frequently on buttons to draw your attention to the fact that you could select that element with your mouse </p>
<p> Vendor prefixs are helpful for the time being. </p>
<p> Now we can use depth as the z axis. </p>
<p> Rotate use positive and negative values</p>
<p> Scale using values between .01 and .9</p>
<p> Translate value uses x and y on the horizontal and vertical axis, can use positive and negatives values</p>
<p> Skew will distort values on th x/y axises and measured in degrees</p>
<p> Common to see multiple transforms used at once. </p>
<p> Transform origin is the center of the element. In order to amend this use transform-origin
<p> Perspective, need to establish a vanishing point. Prespective depth value: none for no impact, and length for a higher prespective. </p>
<p> Noted that backface visibility will be very important in animations. </p>
