### CSS Transformations 
https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/
<p>What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element? </p>
<p> Rotate, scale, translate, skew an element. 
<p>Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.</p>
<p> I think you see scale frequently on buttons to draw your attention to the fact that you could select that element with your mouse </p>
<p> Vendor prefixs are helpful for the time being. </p>
<p> Now we can use depth as the z axis. </p>
<p> Rotate use positive and negative values</p>
<p> Scale using values between .01 and .9</p>
<p> Translate value uses x and y on the horizontal and vertical axis, can use positive and negatives values</p>
<p> Skew will distort values on th x/y axises and measured in degrees</p>
<p> Common to see multiple transforms used at once. </p>
<p> Transform origin is the center of the element. In order to amend this use transform-origin
<p> Perspective, need to establish a vanishing point. Prespective depth value: none for no impact, and length for a higher prespective. </p>
<p> Noted that backface visibility will be very important in animations. </p>

### CSS Transitions and Animations
<p> https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/ </p>
<p>What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?</p>
<p> allows developers to alter the behavior and appearance of elements </p>
<p>How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?</p>
<p> More about drawing in the other element, but this allows more animations. </p>
<p> transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, transition-delay </p>
<p> Use transition with a property such as background and can be separated by commas </p>
<p> Not all properties can be transitioned. </p>
<p> Use s and ms for transition-duration and use of fractions. </p>
<p> transition timing key words include linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out </p>
<p>transition: background .2s linear, border-radius 1s ease-in 1s </p>
<p> card flip demo is rad. </p>
<p> declare the animation name to the property on an element, via animation-name. </p>
<p> You can specify if the animation will stop with an integer or infinite. </p>
<p> animation-direction, animation-iteration, animation-duration, animation-timing-function, animation-delay, animation-direction (normal, reverse, alternate, alternate-reverse), animation-play-state (paused, running), animation-fill-mode (none, forwards, backwards, both) </p>
<p> shorthand can be used, which I would have to have a ton of practice or note out separately to roll up like this example. </p>
