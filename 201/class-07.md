## Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

### Things I Want to Know More About

### Domain Modeling
<p> The process of creating a conceptual model in code for a problem. </p>
<p> The model describes various entities, attributes, behaviors and constraints. </p>
<p> An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model. </p>
<p> You want to build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors, so that when you change the algorithm for determining popularity, the changes can be targeted. </p>
<p> Really quite cool to do this in replit and follow along in the reading. </p>
<p> Prototype subs in to do the work. The function uses Math.floor and Math.random to calculate and return a random interger between min and max. </p>
<p> Sharing code consumes less memory. </p>
<ol>
<li>When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.</li>
<li>Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.</li>
<li>Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.</li>
<li>Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.</li>
<li>Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.</li>
<li>Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.</li>
</ol>

### Tables
<p> A table is a grid. using <//table> to initate and <//tr> to create a row. <//th> creates the heading. <//td> represents the data. </p>
<p> You have to create empty cells (upper right corner is blank on tables usually).</p>
<p> Scope will allow you to denote columns(col) and rows(row) and colspan will allow you to span across the columns. </p>
<p> <//thead>, <//tbody>, <//tfoot>, allows you to pin these items when users scroll. </p>


### Functions, Methods, Objects
<p> All the functions at the end of the questions section allow you to call the questions at that point by grouping things together within the code. </p>
<p> Local variables are only remembered while the function is being invoked. Global have to be remembered the whole time.</p>   
<p> Access the properties or methods of an object using dot notation. </p>
<p> Constructor notation is this.name = name this.rooms=rooms This is used instead of the object name to indicate that the property or mthod belongs to the object that this function creates.</p>
<p> Ends in a colon (not a comma). Begins with a capital letter. </p>
<p> You create instances of the object using the constructor function. </p>
<p> The new keyword followed by a call function.
