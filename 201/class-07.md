## Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

### Things I Want to Know More About
<p> Built in objects. 

### Domain Modeling
<p> The process of creating a conceptual model in code for a problem. </p>
<p> The model describes various entities, attributes, behaviors and constraints. </p>
<p> An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model. </p>
<p> You want to build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors, so that when you change the algorithm for determining popularity, the changes can be targeted. </p>
<p> Really quite cool to do this in replit and follow along in the reading. </p>
<p> Prototype subs in to do the work. The function uses Math.floor and Math.random to calculate and return a random interger between min and max. </p>
<p> Sharing code consumes less memory. </p>
<ol>
<li>When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.</li>
<li>Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.</li>
<li>Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.</li>
<li>Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.</li>
<li>Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.</li>
<li>Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.</li>
</ol>

### Tables
<p> A table is a grid. using <//table> to initate and <//tr> to create a row. <//th> creates the heading. <//td> represents the data. </p>
<p> You have to create empty cells (upper right corner is blank on tables usually).just a blank brackets in the list of the tags creating the rows and columns</p>
<p> Scope will allow you to denote columns(col) and rows(row) and colspan will allow you to span across the columns. </p>
<p> <//thead>, <//tbody>, <//tfoot>, allows you to pin these items when users scroll. </p>


### Functions, Methods, Objects
<p> All the functions at the end of the questions section allow you to call the questions at that point by grouping things together within the code. </p>
<p> Local variables are only remembered while the function is being invoked. Global have to be remembered the whole time.</p>   
<p> Access the properties or methods of an object using dot notation. A method is a special type of function.  </p>
<p> Constructor notation is this.name = name this.rooms=rooms This is used instead of the variable name to indicate that the property or method belongs to the object that this function creates contextual because it refers to the object it is a part of. </p>
<p> Ends in a colon (not a comma) for a key value pairs. Begins with a capital letter for you as a person to understand the code, but JS doesn't care.  It's a maker of potatoes, not a potato itself. </p>
<p> You make instances of the object using the constructor function. <strong> Use this to update and create new properties, the dot notation is just a longer variable. Method is a part of an object. </strong></p>
<p> The new keyword, makes the constructor works, then followed by a call function.</p>
<p> Objects created with constructors are good when you have a lot of similar objects. </p>
<p> There are built in objects that help you retrieve user entries. </p>
<p>Built in objects include DOM, Browser Object Model, Global Javascript Objects. </p>
<p>Browser Object is the current window, including window.innerHeight, window.innnerWidth, window.pageXOffset, window.pageYOffset, window.screenX, window.screenY, window.location, window.document, window.history, window.history.length, window.screen, window.screen.width, window.screen.height. </p>
<p>window.alert(), window.open(), window.print(), dialog box, new browser, and print the contents. </p>
<p> Dang. I should try that code for the pop up in this book and home sweet home. </p>
<p>DOM: document.title, document.lastModified, document.URL, document.domain, document.write(), document.getElementById(), document.querySelectorAll(), document.createElement(), document.createTextNode(). 
<p> There are lots of cool math objects, not just ceil and floor. </p>
<p> Date object. Times and dates can have many matches. YY, MM, DD, HH, MM, SS</p>
