### Things I Want to Know More About
Just a note that when reviewing this data, it is likely deeply impacted by the pandemic and women being forced to leave the work place to perform unpaid care labor

### Questions

### That Time When Women Stopped Coding

What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
about the same time when PCs started showing up in US homes in significant numbers and the games on them were marketed to men

Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
educators assumed that their students had grown up playing with computers, but culturally girls had not

### Diversity in Tech Companies

When are diversity efforts most successful?
When they're driven by a commitment from company leaders, leaders that understand why diversity matters

Why do diverse companies perform better?
<ul>
<li>They have more and different ways of seeing a problem and therefore faster/better ways of solving problems</li>
<li>They have better finaical performance</li>
<li>Diverse individuals bring diverse ideas and so cutting diverse candidates out, cuts the companies out of hiriing talented employees </li>
<li> They serve a diverse user base and bridge some data gaps </li>
</ul>

Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
Did you know that many cars on the market do not detect women's voices and have to be programmed by men?
Voice recognition tools do not recognize higher pitched voices.

Maybe car companies could build cars with technology that protects women so that we aren't 20% to 28% more likely to DIE IN THEM in the event of a car crash. Maybe they could use crash test dummies that are women and not smaller men.
