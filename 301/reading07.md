### Questions

Who is Roy Fielding?
wrote the first web servers, that sent documents. http tells the browser what protocol to use, then describes the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. 

Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
In the beginning humans did, but then we worked with smaller groups of machines and needed to be able to describe from one machine to another--how to find what we were looking for. Machines don't have a universal noun, each language, database, system has a different way of talking about nouns, as well. 

What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
uses a URL to tell other systems about each other's nouns. Via polymorphism, different nouns can have the same verb applied to them.

What does a GET do? a verb that is polymorphic
gets a human readable version of the machine readable data

What does a POST do?
adds something from one system to another

What does PUT do?
replaces something from one system to another

What does PATCH do?
partial update from one system to another
