##growth mindset

-*when we're growing, we're more productive!*
-**Your fundamental abilities can be developed via hard work**
-Like ice hockey, celebrating incremental achievements and never giving up, are the keys to improvement. 

Some methods to troubleshoot:
1. break the problem down into the smallest steps
1. talk it through
1. stay focused
1. take breaks
1. ***you never regret a practice that you attend instead of staying at home***
1. look at the good, bad, and ugly parts of your day to learn
1. see others as your teammates and not your competition
1. ~~I love a strikethrough~~
